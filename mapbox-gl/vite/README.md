# formatting

There are only two rules in the `.prettierrc` file:

- single quotes
- no semicolons

# single file html

The dev dependency `vite-plugin-singlefile` and the file `vite.config.js` make sure that running `npm run build` creates a single html file.

# linting

The eslint and friends dev dependencies, and the config file `eslint.config.js` make eslint available.
